# GageHud
GageHud is now on GitHub. As I am busy with real work, it may not be updated as often as I wish I could. It has been tested with Update 70 and until now it works. Fixed some bugs caused by new enemies (And myself).

###Features are:
* Hud-StatsScreen
* CustomHud
* DynamicHud
* MiniMap(The Casino Map is not that accurate)
* Percentage HudSuspicion
* Kill-Counter
* Skip Restart Counter (Not tested with other players in the lobby)
* Flashlight Extender
* Bullet Decapitations
* Preplanned
* And many more...

###Suggestions
Currently I have not planned to do anything new and I don't have the time for it. I am totally happy if I am able to fix bugs in time.

###Contribution and BugFixes
Create a pull request and I will look into it.
